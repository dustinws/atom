    ([\#1248](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/issues/1248))
    (by Paul Ermolin)

    Command is `typescript:initialize-config`, and it uses `tsc init`
    under the hood. Note that this is also an activation command,
    meaning you can use it without opening a TypeScript file first.
    However, it determines the project path from currently-active text
    editor -- if there aren't any text editors open, command doesn't do
    anything.

    No keybinding is assigned by default, since this is not a command
    one would use often.

-   Documentation updates
-   Remove obsolete `filesGlob` snippet
-   Don't use deprecated `.editor` class in grammar style
-   Add locale setting to control TypeScript's message locale
    ([\#1371](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/issues/1371))

## 12.0.0

-   **Switch to Atom's TypeScript grammar** (potentially
    compatibility-breaking)

    We're discontinuing our own grammar in favor of language-typescript,
    which is bundled with Atom. **Please make sure that
    language-typescript package is activated, we have no way of
    activating it for you.**

-   Cache constructed TypescriptBuffers by TextBuffers.

    Hopefully this helps with issues like \#1300 and \#1332

-   Show tooltip command

    Closes \#957. Adds `typescript:show-tooltip` command to show type
    tooltip at current text cursor position.

-   Configurable autocomplete-plus `suggestionPriority`

    Closes \#1185. Exactly what it says on the tin, allows configuring
    priority of TypeScript's autocompletion suggestions.

-   Moved config schema to package.json

    This should speed up Atom start-up times, since it doesn't need to
    load package source until needed.

-   Change target to ES7/2016

    Atom supports full ES7 now, so no reason not to, really.

-   Support for atom-ide-ui

    No installation prompt if atom-ide-ui or linter is detected, support
    for atom-ide-ui code fixes.

-   Do not show progress bar for emit

    This never worked properly, and a progress bar would get stuck in
    the panel after emit, so this is treated as a bug and removed for
    now.

-   Updated installation instructions in README

-   TypeScript 2.5: exclude tsconfig.json from project files on emit

## 11.0.8

-   Speed up autocomplete and fix a disposable leak

Please note only breaking changes are logged beyond this point. You can

<https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/compare/v7.0.0...v8.0.0>
shows all changes since v7.0.0 until v8.0.0

## v11.0.0

-   Major rewrite using `tsserver` API for the best compatibility with
    the current versions of Typescript.

## v7.0.0

-   Removed the (already ignored in any significant way) `version`
    option from tsconfig.
    [More](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/issues/617)

## v6.0.0

-   Bring back `dts-generator` as using the other mechanism has a few
    gotchas that might surprise new users. We will remove this feature
    once <https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/2338> is
    officially supported.

## v5.0.0

-   We no longer *automatically* create a `tsconfig.json`. However we
    provide a *command* "TypeScript: Create tsconfig.json project file".

## v4.8.0

-   Feature: Added ReactJS / `.tsx` support

## v4

-   Removed `dts-generator` support. Reason is that it pollutes the
    global namespace and is no longer the recommended way for sharing
    TypeScript code. See
    <https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/2338> for the way
    forward.

## v3

-   We will now resolve a parent `package.json` for you *automatically*
    so that its *one less thing you need to configure*. :rose:

## v2

-   New default shortcuts for `build` : `F6` an `goto definition`:
    `F12`. Because I don't want to mess with your atom defaults and a
    major use base is VS users. [Link
    \#145](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/issues/145)

## v1

-   `format` â†’ `formatCodeOptions`
    https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/issues/178
-   `compileOnSave` is now a tsconfig option :
    https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/issues/187
